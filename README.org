#+TITLE: Docker Registry -- Hub Mirror and Local Private

* About

  This is a simple Docker Compose system that lets one run 2 Docker
  Registries on the same system:

  - A Registry acting as a mirror for the Docker Hub
  - A Registry for private images, meant for local development and
    sharing between Docker hosts (including localhost as well as Docker
    Machines and Minikube)

* How to use

  Launch this just like any Compose system:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker-compose up -d
  #+END_SRC

  Then, update your Docker host's =dockerd= configuration to run with the
  =--registry-mirror= and =--insecure-registry= options.  For example, on
  systems using =/etc/default/docker= for configuration:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sh
  # on systems using /etc/default/docker
  DOCKER_OPTS="--registry-mirror=http://127.0.0.1:50000 --insecure-registry=192.168.42.1:50001"
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  And for systems using =/etc/docker/daemon.json=:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE json
  {
      "insecure-registries": ["192.168.42.1:50001"],
      "registry-mirrors": ["http://127.0.0.1:5000"]
  }
  #+END_EXAMPLE
